1. Put camera in manual exposure mode
2. Expose for either the brightest area or the main subject of the image
3. Set the focus on the main subject and then set the camera into manual focus mode
4. General rule for overlap is 1/3 for mid-range lenses (35mm and above), wider lenses require more overlap
